# Reasoning

## Tasks you focused on - why
- For the Node.js backend I implemented the add movie functionality.
- In the getting Individual Movie function, I added an extra condition that outputs a message if a movie is not found
- I wrote tests to cover each method's implementation.
- I also added Eslint and Prettier to the project to enforce a standard and to format respectively


## Tasks you would do later - why
- I also added two extra methods to be able to update and delete data, just to give the backend full functionality. These two methods have been commented out as an id will be needed to implement them. The tests for these methods were also commented out.
- For the Node.js backend, I'd love to integrate a type of backend, so I'd be able to deploy it.
